# Smart-Car-Parking-Management-System-Final-Year-Project-
Smart Car Parking Management System is an IoT-based management system to identify which parking area is occupied or available, dependent on sensory inputs to design a real-time parking map. The map will be available to the driver through a mobile application and the web before entering the parking lot, thus avoiding traffic congestion and time wastage. In each parking slot, there will be sensors that will detect cars’ movement and update it on the digital map. The project is designed according to the university parking. Hence, it will also keep track of authorized vehicles entering the parking lot and notify each person’s payment. The system makes it easier to detect empty parking spots and provides security features to allow access to only authorized vehicles.
